WRONGPASSWORD
Explanation:
This Program includes three classes: Edge,Node, and Graph. Each of these classes
are added as objects within the program to create a Directed Graph that represents
towns within KiwiLand. Nodes are the building blocks of the directed graph and act
as the vertices/towns of the directed graph. Within the edge class, Nodes are added
as member variables including the starting node and ending node. A weight variable is 
part of the Edge class also acting as a distance. The Graph class is the main class
of the program and includes various search methods. 

Instructions:
The Program can be compiled and run through the command line interface. If
Assuming that the user has unzipped the program directory and currently 
within the program directory path: First compile the three files by typing the following

% javac -g Edge.java
% javac -g Node.java
% javac -g Graph.java

After compilation, now type:

% java Graph

After running this, the test output should now show on the console.

Output #1: 9
Output #2: 5
Output #3: 13
Output #4: 22
Output #5: NO SUCH ROUTE
Output #6: 2
Output #7: 3
Output #8: 9
Output #9: 9
Output #10: 7

This output shows the result for the test input: 
Graph: AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7.
